# Standardizing SUV Computation

## Project Aims

Our goal is to standardize how DICOM PET images are converted to SUVs – an essential step in PET image analysis. 

## Current Status

We are happy to introduce the first version our manual for standardized uptake value (SUV) computation:

The .docx version of the manual is available for download here:

[Manual - .docx version](https://github.com/michaelvacha/suv_computation/blob/main/manual/suv.docx)

Digital reference objects (DROs) and the final version of the manual will be released in subsequent updates.
